Thanks for downloading this transformation pack.


This is a major update for the Windows 10 to Windows 7 Transformation Pack, Having more accuracy fixes over the previous version, supporting 21H2/22H2 versions of Windows 10 thanks to OpenGlass made by alTaleX531 and having newer (older) additions like the Windows 7 network panel, restored Control panel, the legacy User Account Control dialog and much more. 

This Trasnformation Pack isn't a 1:1 replica of Windows 7 and will never be a perfect replica of it. So please don't point miniscule changes that won't impact the user experience.

This transformation pack is for Windows 10 (IoT) LTSC 2021 version 21H2 and Home/Pro/Enterprise version 22H2 (19045.xxx).


Rules of distribution, the credits, and all of that stuff can be found in the Terms and Conditions inside of the installer.

Notes: 

- You MUST update your system to at least 2024's set of Windows Updates to prevent Windows Update from bricking your install when done.
- Stage 2 & 3 will take some time. Let it do their thing.
- Some options are En-US only and might not work on other languages.
- Legacy UAC will break authentication prompts.
- The Redirect control panel settings isn't complete like it is on 7. If you want the full control panel restoration you can find it here: https://winclassic.net/thread/1779/restoring-control-panel-applets-windows
- Chrome browsers & firefox forks (past version 116) do not have native titlebars anymore so it's impossible to have aero glass on them. If you are using Firefox 115 ESR you can use this patch to enable Aero back: https://github.com/Kawapure/firefox-native-controls
