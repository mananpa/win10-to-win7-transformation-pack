Windhawk command-line flags
===========================

One question that comes up a lot is how to run Windhawk without opening the main
window. This is possible with the -tray-only flag, as following:

windhawk.exe -tray-only

Other command-line flags that may be useful:

windhawk.exe -exit [-wait]
windhawk.exe -restart [-tray-only]
