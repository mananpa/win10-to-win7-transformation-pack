# Windows 10 to Windows 7 Transformation Pack

This transformation pack is made/compiled by [Windows Saturn](https://youtu.be/91i1F3yzLa00). I only updated programs to latest version and added addional apps, tips.

100% working! Tested on Windows 10 22H2.

### Installation
Read [this](Readme%20and%20Credits.txt) file and watch [this](https://youtu.be/91i1F3yzLa00).

#### Note

Please know that HackBGRT is UEFI-only and you must *disable Secure Boot* in your BIOS setup! Otherwise, it will not work.

You can easily access BIOS setup by doing this (would be recommended to print this out or remember it yourself):
Go to the start menu, hold left shift key and restart. Go to advanced settings and look for an UEFI firmware option. Click on it.
Don't be scared of what it shows. If you have a BIOS password, enter it. Go to the boot tab (or something similar) and disable Secure Boot. Save settings and exit.
It should restart the computer. Now you can use HackBGRT! It is *still advised* you use it with caution, as it can brick your Windows installation.

### Credits
Here are credits to a few:
